## PI Model Reference

We will use the `pi-mono` project as a guiding reference while expanding this agent's capabilities incrementally through Telegram-driven interaction.

Scope and intent:
- Treat `pi-mono` as a blueprint for architecture and behavioral patterns.
- Apply changes in small, reliable steps that preserve runtime stability and conversation continuity.
- Prioritize compatibility with the current Rust-based codebase and the constraints in `AGENTS.md`.

Notes:
- This is a guidance document, not a direct port plan.
